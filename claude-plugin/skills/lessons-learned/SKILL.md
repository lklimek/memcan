# Lessons Learned

Extract and persist learnings from the current conversation in three phases.

## Phase 1 — Gather

Scan conversation history for items worth remembering:

- Lessons learned — bugs, pitfalls, failed approaches, workarounds
- Architecture decisions — choices made and their rationale
- User preferences — coding style, tool choices, conventions
- Patterns and anti-patterns — recurring solutions or mistakes
- Configuration quirks — project-specific setup, environment gotchas

Collect as a raw numbered list. Search existing memories (`search_memories`) and drop duplicates. Do NOT save anything yet.

## Phase 2 — Categorize

For each item, assign **scope** and **type**.

Scope (default = global):
- **Global** — language/framework knowledge, tooling tips, general patterns, debugging techniques, workflow preferences. Anything useful across projects.
- **Project-scoped** — project-specific config, architecture unique to this repo, repo-specific conventions that would not apply elsewhere. Set `project` to git repo basename.

Type: `lesson`, `decision`, or `preference`.

Present the categorized list to the user via `AskUserQuestion`. Format each item as:

```
1. <summary> — 🌍 global / lesson
2. <summary> — 📁 project / decision
```

The user may adjust scopes, types, or remove items before proceeding.

## Phase 3 — Save

For each approved item, invoke the `remember` skill with the determined scope and type.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Example |
|------|---------|
| `search_memories` | `search_memories(query="docker cache", project="penny", limit=5)` |
| `get_memories` | `get_memories(project="penny", limit=50)` or `get_memories()` for global |
| `add_memory` | `add_memory(memory="...", project="penny", metadata={"type": "lesson"})` |
| `delete_memory` | `delete_memory(memory_id="<uuid>")` |
| `update_memory` | `update_memory(memory_id="<uuid>", memory="...")` |
| `count_memories` | `count_memories(project="penny")` or `count_memories()` for global |

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** — "Axum `.layer()` ordering: last added = outermost" beats "middleware ordering matters"
2. **Include context** — mention framework, language, project when relevant
3. **Tag metadata** — `type` (lesson/decision/preference), `source` (LL-NNN, PR#)
4. **Don't duplicate** — search before adding; update existing memories if needed
